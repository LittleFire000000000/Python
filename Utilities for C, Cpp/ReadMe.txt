These do various tedious tasks for those C/C++ people who don't use IDEs.

Distribute.bat uses a list of files (list.txt) to make a release ZIP file.
Project_compiler.py is a simple tool for compiling simple C/C++ projects' source files.
Prototypes.py displays headers' single-line function prototypes ending in a comment.
Srt.bat starts cmd.
The renewal bats take the command-line arguments file_name & folder to copy file_name to all other instances of file_name under folder.
